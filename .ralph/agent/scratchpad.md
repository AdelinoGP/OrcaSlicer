# Scratchpad

- Selected T574 (`src/slic3r/GUI/Search.hpp`) as the next ready Phase 1 task.
- The file combines two popup search controllers: preset options and object search.
- Main Unity migration note: model the current wxPopupWindow + custom-painted rows as a floating controller with a persistent filtered list view and explicit dismiss/focus handling.
- Search.hpp now carries declaration-level annotations for the shared popup boundary, option/result DTOs, manual row painting, and both dialog controllers.
